# Load Forecasting Web Application

This project is a web-based application for real-time electrical load forecasting, developed as a user-friendly tool for energy management. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and real-time weather data, the application provides accurate load predictions based on city-specific inputs. The project was assigned by **Dr. Devendra Singh** and developed to make advanced load forecasting accessible and intuitive through a simple website interface.

## Features

- **Real-Time Predictions**: Predicts electrical load demand for a specified city.
- **Weather Data Integration**: Utilizes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and holiday indicators for enhanced forecasting accuracy.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Combines linear regression with advanced techniques like LSTM for reliable predictions.
- **User-Friendly Web Interface**: Built with HTML, CSS, Flask, and JavaScript for seamless user experience.

## Technical Overview

- **Frontend**: Developed using HTML and CSS, providing a clean and responsive interface.
- **Backend**: Built with Flask, hosting pre-trained machine learning models and handling prediction requests.
- **Machine Learning**: Models trained using Python libraries, including Scikit-learn for linear regression and TensorFlow for advanced algorithms.
- **Weather API**: Real-time data fetched via OpenWeatherMap API for accurate feature inputs.
- **Deployment**: Designed for scalability and easy integration into energy management systems.
